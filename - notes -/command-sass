php bin/console sass:build --watch

Deploying
When you deploy, run sass:build command before the asset-map:compile command so the built file is available:

php bin/console sass:build
php bin/console asset-map:compile

# Install Sass globally
npm install -g sass

# Watch your custom Sass for changes and compile it to CSS
sass --watch assets\styles\bootstrap.scss public\bootstrap.css
